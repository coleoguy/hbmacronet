* Simulate phylogenetic trees with [diversitree](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diversitree/index.html)
* Convert trees to ms format, and add some hybridization
    - [popplanner](http://www.mabs.at/ewing/msms/popplanner.shtml) (GUI)
    - [Heath's script](http://coleoguy.blogspot.com/2017/05/converting-trees-to-ms-format.html)
* On those clade histories, simulate gene trees with [ms](http://home.uchicago.edu/rhudson1/source/mksamples.html)
* Simulate sequences on each gene tree with [seq-gen](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/seqgen/)
* Concatenate sequences and phylogeny with [mrbayes](http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/)

Some of this software doesn't run on Windows.  One solution is to run [bio-linux](http://environmentalomics.org/bio-linux/) as a virtual machine.
